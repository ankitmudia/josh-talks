## Challenges

1. Before this project i had not worked on any server side rendering, so had to study before implementing it, earlier i had theoretical idea of it.
2. This was the first time i deployed Application through vercel, there were no errors or warnings before deploying but vercel gave an error without any line number(for redux), took sometime to debug
